<h2><u>Chronology</u></h2>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p>The history of Earth concerns the development of planet Earth from its formation to the present day.[1][2] Nearly all branches of natural science have contributed to understanding of the main events of Earth's past, characterized by constant geological change and biological evolution.
	</p>
<a id="for"></a>
<h4><u>formation</u></h4>
	<p>The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5672±0.0006 billion years ago (Bya).[35] By 4.54±0.04 Bya[36] the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun.</p>
<a id="geo"></a>
<h4><u>geological history</u></h4>
	<p>Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.[42] Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.[43] In this model, atmospheric "greenhouse gases" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity

<h2><u>phisical characteristics</u></h2>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
<p>
	Figure of the Earth is a term of art in geodesy that refers to the size and shape used to model Earth. The size and shape it refers to depend on context, including the precision needed for the model. The sphere is an approximation of the figure of the Earth that is satisfactory for many purposes. S

<h4><u>shape</u></h4>
	<p>The shape of Earth is nearly spherical. There is a small flattening at the poles and bulging around the equator due to Earth's rotation.[82] To second order, the Earth is approximately an oblate spheroid, whose equatorial diameter is 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter,[83] although the variation is less than 1% of the average radius of the Earth.

<a id="che"></a>
<h4><u>chemical composition</u></h4>
	<p>Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulphur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulphur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[91]

<h2><u>orbit and rotation</u></h2>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
<p>It takes the planet Earth about 23.9 hours to complete one rotation on its axis. Complete orbit around the Sun takes about 365.26 days. The Earth's rotation axis is tilted relative to the imaginary space orbit around the Sun. This imaginary plane is called the ecliptic plane.Feb </p>
<a id="orb"></a>

<h4><u>orbit</u></h4>
	<p>Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours.
	</p>
	<a id="rot"></a>
		
<h4><u>rotation</u></h4>
	<p>Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds).[172] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer.[173][174]
